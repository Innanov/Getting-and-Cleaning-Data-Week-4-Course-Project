# Tidydata set description

## The original data was transformed by:

1.Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4.Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Descriptions

###### Identififiers

The first two columns - Subject and Activity - are Identifiers.
*Subject: the ID of the Subject
*Activity: the Name of the Activity performed by the subject when measurements were taken.
